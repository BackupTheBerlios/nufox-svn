 Nufox

Jargon: 

Nufox_ is a Python_, Twisted_ and Nevow_ derived server-side XUL_
framework created to produce GUI's renderable in Gecko_ based viewers.

Now thats out of the way,

Nufox is a framework for developing applications with the kind of
graphical user interfaces that people expect from modern desktop
applications. The cool thing about nufox is that you get to do this
from the comfort of your webserver, as Nufox applications are
distributed via HTTP in the same way any conventional web app
is. Nufox is comparable to solutions like Laszlo_, but without the
Java or need to write XML.

How does this benifit you?
--------------------------

- Your Application is cross platform, and will render using the native
  toolkit on Linux, OSX and Windows.

- You don't need to worry about distributing a client, the Mozilla
  people have that angle covered.

- As there is no client to distribute, there are no client/server
  version mis-match issues, if you make a change to the UI it is
  propagated to your users.

- Your client/server communication happens over port 80, resulting in
  reduced firewall issues and sys admin angst.

- A bevvey of tools already exist to support development, ie: the
  Mozilla DOM Inspector, Venkman the Javascript Debugger, and more.

- Nufox provides the benifits of the XUL platform, without the need to
  write a single line of markup.

An example::

    from nufox import xul
    
    class MyPage(xul.XULPage):

        def __init__(self):
            self.window = xul.Window(title="nufox!", width=400, height=400)
            self.button = xul.Button(label="Push Me")
            self.button.addHandler('oncommand', self.pushed)
            self.window.append(self.button)

        def pushed(self):
            print "You pushed me"
