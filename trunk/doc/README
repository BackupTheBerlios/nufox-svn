Nufox Documentation Howto:

Much thanks to twisted.web2 hackers, who wrote this documentation system which
I liberated for Nufox.

To build documentation:

#Requires python docutils!

$ cd generation-scripts/
$ ./make.sh

Documentation will be built into html/

To add new documentation:

1. copy or create one of the txt files in this directory and edit.
2. edit generation-scripts/hier.py and add your doco to the structure.
