Athena was to be a part of the 0.5 nevow release and is a hard dependancy 
for nufox. With the 0.5 release announced and no athena included with it
I've copied the athena code from exarkun's callRemote-2 branch of nevow to
Nufox. This will be periodically updated until a time comes when athena is
released with nevow. Glyph says that should be 0.6 which is only a few 
weeks away.
